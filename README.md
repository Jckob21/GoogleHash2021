# GoogleHash2021

This is my first attempt on Google Hash competition. I managed to score 3,134,475 points with my teammate Jing.

The code is very messy and doesn't follow any coding conventions as our first script didn't work and we had litle time to provide a solution.

It is clearly not the best aproach to the problem but it was amazing experience and I learned a lot of things!
